# PC setup host

The setup host is built by remote-loader's `tools/build_host.py`; this
repository does not maintain a separate DNS/HTTPS implementation. The generated
`webkit-autoloader-host_v<version>.py` embeds standalone HTML pages for both chains
(Relapse and Poops) carrying the installer ELF and a TLS certificate. At runtime, it
automatically routes firmwares where Relapse is unsupported (9.05, 11.40) to Poops.
It needs only Python's standard library.

Run the generated script, set the PS5's DNS to your PC's IP, then open Settings →
User's Guide. The page runs the exploit and installer; reboot after installation.
On systems requiring elevated privileges for ports 53/443, run the host with sudo.

For a local HTTP check without DNS or HTTPS:

```sh
python3 webkit-autoloader-host_v<version>.py --no-dns --no-https --http-port 8123
```

Use `--help` for upstream host options. `--extract <directory>` extracts the
embedded page. Build both versioned artifacts with `./build_release.sh`, or build
only the host from an existing installer with:

```sh
make host HOST_PAYLOAD=webkit-autoloader-installer_v<version>.elf
```
